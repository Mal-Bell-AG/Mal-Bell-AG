# Hi there, I'm Malcolm Bell.

I'm a scientist and VTuber, affiliated with **Amber Glow**.

- I'm working on machine learning, data analysis, and video game design.
- I'm _currently_ learning *Keras* and *Tensorflow*, and finding interesting applications for the *Live2D* SDK and *Ren'Py*.
- I'd love to learn more about **networking** and **Unreal Engine 4/5**
- I'm looking to collaborate on creating fun and informative content.
- Ask me about AI, machine learning, astrophysics and game design.
- How to reach me: by [email](malcolm@amberglow.live), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/malcolm_of_bell)
- Fun fact: I do a lot of my thinking and planning while hiking and spending time outdoors.
